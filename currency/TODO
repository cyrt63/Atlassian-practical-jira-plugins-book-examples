TODO

Symbol appears on the left for all reading directions in
edit. NumberFormat.format() for Currency decides this.

Any m or k suffix is not preserved when you edit the field again

DONE

form.aui reduces text class from 90% to 250px in edit, but in editing
the default the width is 90%. In Number Field, long-field class
reduces it to 500px. Just changed it to a CSS style 200px

m and k suffix appear to work in the default but is not applied? No,
it is, but not in an issue you are part way through creating
